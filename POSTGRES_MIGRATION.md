# PostgreSQL Deduplication Migration

## Overview

This document describes the migration from Airtable-based duplicate detection to PostgreSQL-based deduplication. This change significantly improves performance, reliability, and observability of the scraping system.

## Architecture Change

### Before (Airtable-based)
```
Scrape -> Extract -> Check Airtable for duplicates (N API calls) -> Upload to Airtable
```

**Problems:**
- 100+ API calls for duplicate checking (one per rating)
- Race conditions between concurrent workers
- Complex caching logic (local + Redis)
- Rate limiting bottlenecks
- No audit trail

### After (PostgreSQL-based)
```
Scrape -> Extract -> Save to PostgreSQL (atomic deduplication) -> Sync to Airtable (new only)
```

**Benefits:**
- ~1 ms per duplicate check (vs ~100 ms Airtable API call)
- Zero race conditions (database UNIQUE constraint)
- 90% fewer Airtable API calls
- Complete audit trail in PostgreSQL
- Easy retry of failed syncs

## Key Improvements

### 1. Performance
- **Duplicate Detection**: < 1ms (database constraint) vs 100ms (API call)
- **Batch Processing**: 1000s of records/second vs limited by API rate
- **API Calls Reduced**: ~90% reduction in Airtable API usage

### 2. Reliability
- **Atomic Deduplication**: PostgreSQL UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicates automatically
- **No Race Conditions**: Database handles concurrent inserts correctly
- **No Cache Invalidation**: Database is always consistent

### 3. Observability
- **Full History**: Every scraping run stored permanently
- **Easy Queries**: Standard SQL for analytics
- **Sync Status**: Track which records are synced to Airtable
- **Failure Tracking**: Identify and retry failed syncs

## Database Schema

### Tables

#### `companies`
Stores company records with Airtable ID mappings.

```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_name VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    airtable_record_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### `credit_ratings`
All scraped ratings with automatic deduplication.

```sql
CREATE TABLE credit_ratings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id),
    company_name VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    instrument VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    rating VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    outlook VARCHAR(100),
    instrument_amount VARCHAR(200),
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    source_url TEXT,
    airtable_record_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    scraped_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP,
    job_id VARCHAR(50),
    sync_failed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    sync_error TEXT,
    -- Core deduplication constraint
    CONSTRAINT unique_rating UNIQUE (company_name, instrument, rating, date)
);
```

#### `scrape_jobs`
Tracks all scraping jobs with statistics.

```sql
CREATE TABLE scrape_jobs (
    job_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    total_scraped INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    new_records INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    duplicate_records INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    uploaded_to_airtable INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    sync_failures INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## How It Works

### 1. Scraping and Extraction (Unchanged)
```python
# Scrape HTML from Infomerics
response = scraper.scrape_date_range(start_date, end_date)

# Extract credit ratings from HTML
ratings = extractor.extract_company_data(html_content)
```

### 2. Save to PostgreSQL (New - Atomic Deduplication)
```python
# Insert with automatic duplicate detection
INSERT INTO credit_ratings (company_name, instrument, rating, date, ...)
VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (company_name, instrument, rating, date) DO NOTHING
RETURNING id;
```

**Key Point**: PostgreSQL's UNIQUE constraint handles deduplication automatically and atomically. No application logic needed!

### 3. Sync to Airtable (New - Only New Records)
```python
# Query unsynced records
SELECT * FROM credit_ratings 
WHERE job_id = ? AND airtable_record_id IS NULL;

# Upload to Airtable in batches
for batch in unsynced_ratings:
    airtable_records = airtable.batch_create(batch)
    
    # Update PostgreSQL with Airtable IDs
    UPDATE credit_ratings 
    SET airtable_record_id = ?, uploaded_at = NOW()
    WHERE id IN (...);
```

## Usage

### Running with PostgreSQL Deduplication

The new system is enabled by default. To use it:

```bash
# Set in .env file
USE_POSTGRES_DEDUPLICATION=true

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Database initializes automatically on first run
```

### Fallback to Old System

If needed, you can revert to Airtable-based deduplication:

```bash
# Set in .env file
USE_POSTGRES_DEDUPLICATION=false

# Restart services
docker-compose restart api celery-scraper celery-extractor celery-uploader celery-general
```

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Check PostgreSQL Connection

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U infomerics_user -d infomerics

# Test query
SELECT version();
```

### View Recent Jobs

```sql
-- Using the pre-built view
SELECT * FROM recent_jobs_summary LIMIT 10;

-- Or query directly
SELECT 
    job_id,
    start_date,
    end_date,
    status,
    total_scraped,
    new_records,
    duplicate_records,
    uploaded_to_airtable,
    sync_failures
FROM scrape_jobs
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Duplicate Detection Stats

```sql
-- Duplicate rates by job
SELECT * FROM duplicate_detection_stats LIMIT 20;

-- Overall stats
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_ratings,
    COUNT(DISTINCT company_name) as unique_companies,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE airtable_record_id IS NOT NULL) as synced_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sync_failed = TRUE) as failed_count
FROM credit_ratings;
```

### Find Unsynced Ratings

```sql
-- Using the pre-built view
SELECT * FROM ratings_pending_sync LIMIT 50;

-- Group by job
SELECT 
    job_id,
    COUNT(*) as pending_count,
    MIN(scraped_at) as oldest_pending
FROM credit_ratings
WHERE airtable_record_id IS NULL
GROUP BY job_id
ORDER BY pending_count DESC;
```

### Check Sync Failures

```sql
-- Failed syncs
SELECT 
    id,
    company_name,
    instrument,
    rating,
    date,
    sync_error,
    scraped_at
FROM credit_ratings
WHERE sync_failed = TRUE
ORDER BY scraped_at DESC;

-- Count failures by error type
SELECT 
    sync_error,
    COUNT(*) as failure_count
FROM credit_ratings
WHERE sync_failed = TRUE
GROUP BY sync_error
ORDER BY failure_count DESC;
```

### Daily Scraping Activity

```sql
-- Using the pre-built view
SELECT * FROM daily_scraping_stats LIMIT 30;

-- Custom date range
SELECT 
    DATE(scraped_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as ratings_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT company_name) as companies_count
FROM credit_ratings
WHERE scraped_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(scraped_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

## Manual Operations

### Retry Failed Syncs

To manually retry syncs that failed:

```python
# In a Python shell or script
from api.database import get_unsynced_ratings, update_ratings_airtable_ids
from api.airtable_client import AirtableClient
from api.tasks import sync_postgres_to_airtable_task

# Retry for specific job
job_id = "your-job-id-here"
result = sync_postgres_to_airtable_task.apply_async(
    args=[{'new_records': 0, 'duplicate_records': 0}, job_id]
)
```

Or using SQL to reset failed status:

```sql
-- Reset failed ratings to allow retry
UPDATE credit_ratings
SET sync_failed = FALSE, sync_error = NULL
WHERE job_id = 'your-job-id-here' AND sync_failed = TRUE;

-- Then trigger sync task through API or Celery
```

### Verify Data Consistency

```sql
-- Check for ratings in PostgreSQL but not in Airtable
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM credit_ratings
WHERE airtable_record_id IS NULL 
  AND sync_failed = FALSE
  AND scraped_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- If count > 0, these need to be synced
```

### Backup and Recovery

```bash
# Backup PostgreSQL database
docker-compose exec postgres pg_dump -U infomerics_user infomerics > backup.sql

# Restore from backup
docker-compose exec -T postgres psql -U infomerics_user -d infomerics < backup.sql
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Duplicate Detection
- **Old (Airtable API)**: ~100ms per rating check
- **New (PostgreSQL)**: < 1ms per rating check
- **Improvement**: 100x faster

### Batch Processing
- **Old**: Limited by API rate limits (5 req/sec)
- **New**: 1000s of inserts/second
- **Improvement**: 200x+ throughput

### API Call Reduction
- **Old**: 1 API call per rating for duplicate check + 1 for insert
- **New**: 1 API call per 10 ratings (batch insert only)
- **Improvement**: ~90% fewer API calls

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Connection refused" to PostgreSQL

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps postgres

# Check logs
docker-compose logs postgres

# Restart PostgreSQL
docker-compose restart postgres
```

### Issue: Schema not initialized

**Solution:**
```bash
# Manually run migration
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U infomerics_user -d infomerics -f /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/001_initial_schema.sql

# Or restart API to trigger auto-initialization
docker-compose restart api
```

### Issue: High number of sync failures

**Solution:**
1. Check Airtable API rate limits
2. Verify Airtable credentials
3. Check sync_error field for details:
```sql
SELECT sync_error, COUNT(*) 
FROM credit_ratings 
WHERE sync_failed = TRUE 
GROUP BY sync_error;
```

### Issue: Duplicates still appearing in Airtable

**Solution:**
This shouldn't happen with PostgreSQL deduplication, but if it does:
1. Verify UNIQUE constraint exists:
```sql
\d credit_ratings
```
2. Check if old workflow is being used:
```bash
# In logs, look for:
grep "Using PostgreSQL deduplication" logs/api.log
```
